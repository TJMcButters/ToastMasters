Greetings Toastmaster, fellow Toastmasters, and honored guests.

As Timer, I will keep track of time for each prepared speech, all Table Topics Speakers, and the speech Evaluators.

I will also alert each speaker of the time they have left, using the green, yellow, and red indications, which denote specific times remaining

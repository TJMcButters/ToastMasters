Greetings Toastmaster, fellow Toastmasters, and honored Guests.

The purpose of the Ah Counter is to note words and sounds that are used as a “crutch” or “pause filler” by anyone who speaks.

During the meeting, I will listen for overused words, including and, well, but, so and you know.

I will also listen for filler sounds, including ah, um, and er.

I will also note when a speaker repeats a word or phrase, such as “I, I” or “This means, this means”

At the end of the meeting I will report the number of times that each speaker used these expressions

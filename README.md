# ToastMasters

Toast Masters is a club about learning public speaking skills. It requires that you get in front of a small crowd of people while they critique your speaking, give you some tips, call out your "ahs", "ums", and various other verbal tics. 

They also help you learn to speak off the cuff by having Table Topics, which are speaking prompts that are mostly random, and speakers are selected at random. 

This app's main focus is to assist attendees playing the roles of AhCounter, Grammarian, and Timer, although it could be built out to assist with much more than just those jobs.
